I'm having a change of heart, and feel as it's in my best interest to pivot.
So much of my time has been spent fitting the output of each ShellIndex into
the index of a Texture2DArray that will then, in turn be assigned to each 
instance of the object I want to shell texture. My new thought is this: Why
not take out the middle man?

┌─────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────╖
│ OLD │ GLSL TOP → Texture2DArray → Material → Instances ║
├─────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────╢
│ NEW │           GLSL Material → Instances              ║

Here is the basis for further inquiry:

Passing information between the vertex and pixel shader may or may not be needed.
